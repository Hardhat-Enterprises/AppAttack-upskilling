## What is the MITRE ATT&CK Framework?

The **MITRE ATT&CK** Framework is a globally recognized knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. It provides a comprehensive understanding of how adversaries operate and offers a structured way to categorize cyberattacks.

### Key Elements of MITRE ATT&CK:

- **Tactics**: The high-level goals or objectives an adversary aims to achieve (e.g., initial access, execution, persistence).
- **Techniques**: Specific methods adversaries use to achieve their tactics (e.g., phishing, PowerShell, credential dumping).
- **Sub-techniques**: More granular details about techniques (e.g., spearphishing via link).

### Why Use MITRE ATT&CK?

MITRE ATT&CK can be used by organizations for:

- **Threat intelligence**: To understand adversary behavior.
- **Incident response**: To map and respond to cyberattacks.
- **Defensive measures**: To bolster defenses by mapping them to the framework.

Learn how MITRE ATT&CK can be leveraged for enhanced cybersecurity detection and response.
